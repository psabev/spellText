# Phonetic Spelling Toool

A tool that helps you to spell any reservation code, voucher code, serial number, or practically any other text on the phone with confidence. Spell letters, numbers and special characters using phonetic alphabet to avoid confusion, as many letters may sound similar on the phone, especially when the connection quality is poor.

# A Brief History

While moving the conference date of QA: Challenge Accepted 6.0, I had to reschedule or cancel tens of flights, hotel reservations, reschedule my own holidays, change some order deliveries, and for all of them I had reservation numbers, voucher codes, online ticket numbers, etc. So, I decided to make a quick and easy to implement tool that can be quickly integrated on customer support website or anywhere else with minimum effort - it could save lots of hours to the customer support representatives.

# References

The NATO phonetic alphabet was used and then extended with information from various sources.
